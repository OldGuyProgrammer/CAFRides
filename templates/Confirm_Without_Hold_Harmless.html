<p>Dear {{ purchaser }},</p>
<br>
<p>Thank you for purchasing a ride in the {{ airplane }} on {{ date_of_flight }}. It will be an exciting ride on a genuine World War II warbird. Please arrive at {{airport}} at least one hour before your flight to get prepared and to complete any leftover paperwork.</p>
<br>
<p>Dress comfortably. There are canopies on the airplane, but it will be breezy. Long pants are recommended. Closed toe shoes are required (no sandals). We will provide a headset so that you can hear the pilot communicate with other air traffic and for you to talk to the pilot. You can bring your own aviation headset, if you want.</p>
<br>
