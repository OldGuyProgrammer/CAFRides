<p>Dear {{ purchaser }},</p>
<p>Thank you for purchasing a ride in the {{ airplane }} on {{ date_of_flight }}. It will be an exciting ride on a
    genuine World War II Warbird. Please arrive at {{airport}} at least one hour before your flight to get prepared and
    to complete the paperwork. If the rider is between the ages of 12 and 17, the rider's parent/legal guardian must be present to authorize that person to take the flight.</p>
<p>Dress comfortably. There are canopies on the airplane, but it will be breezy. Long pants are recommended. Closed toe
    shoes are required (no sandals). We will provide a headset so that you can hear the pilot communicate with other air
    traffic and for you to talk to the pilot. You can bring your own aviation headset, if you want.</p>


<p>If you have any questions, do not hesitate to call me at 317-584-7852.</p>
